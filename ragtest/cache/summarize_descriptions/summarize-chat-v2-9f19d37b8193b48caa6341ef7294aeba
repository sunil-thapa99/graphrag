{"result": " The FACE-ATTENDANCE SYSTEM is an automated attendance tracking system that utilizes computer vision techniques, specifically facial recognition technology. This system was developed as a project by Sam Rivera, who implemented the face recognition system using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and OpenCV. In this project, the individual created a system designed to track attendance based on facial recognition.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
